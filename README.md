# LeetCode Journey 🚀

A collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized by difficulty and topic. This repository serves as a personal log of my progress in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Summary
- **Total Problems Solved:** 0 (Updating...)
- **Primary Language:** Python / JavaScript / TypeScript
- **Goal:** To build strong problem-solving intuition for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure
The solutions are organized by difficulty level and topic:
* `/Easy`: Warm-ups and basic logic.
* `/Medium`: Core algorithmic patterns (BFS, DFS, Sliding Window).
* `/Hard`: Advanced optimization and complex data structures.
